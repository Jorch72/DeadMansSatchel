Magical bag that binds to the player and can never be lost

The concept being the bag is to give the player a limited inventory that items can be inserted into to never be lost. The inventory will be very limited preventing most items from being stored. However, will allow things like books, magic gems, and other important items to be stored. This way a player will never lose quest and information based books when they die. While at the same time always having those books on thier person.

Additional the bag should come with a hot key to open books in the inventory and should work with the planned book combination mod. That will combine all books in the inventory into a single accessible GUI.
